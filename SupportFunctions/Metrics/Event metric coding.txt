give  information about the person and trial
ask user to type in the indices for person and trial
if (>1 labeler's data)
	store each label data as a variable
	calculate one-vs-all (choose one labeler's data as reference) scores and differences
	draw a figure that shows difference of the test labelers to the reference labeler
	report the scores
	repeat the calculation step for the rest uncalculated pairs
	report aggregated scores


Improvements:
The relative timing offsets of one labeler labeling events to another labeler labeleling the same event should reflet some systematic different thresholds or roles labelers tend to use. After the confusion matrix on the event level, each type of disagreement can have a weight for seriousness

Procedure:
0. make sure the label sequences are at the same sampling rate
1. clean the labels (fill gaps)

debug the 1-length differencing results

make sure calculate the L2 distance and overlap ratio on the events that matched both at the start and end points
calculate the number for correctly classified events in each class
overlap ratio should be reported for each class?
